# S&P500-Tableau-Dashboard

A Tableau dashboard visualizing S&amp;P 500 stock performance across sectors.

Situation:

As part of my data visualization coursework, I worked with a dataset of S&P 500 companies, which included stock prices, market cap, trading volume, and P/E ratios.The goal was to analyze how different sectors performed over time.

Task:

I needed to build a Tableau dashboard that could clearly show stock trends, sector differences, and overall market movement.

Action:

I cleaned the data in Excel, then used Tableau to create several visualizations —
a line chart to track monthly price trends, a text table to compare market caps and price changes, and a Tree Map where box size represented company market cap and color showed price gain or loss. I also added filters for sectors and time range.

Result：

The final dashboard provided a clear overview of which sectors and companies drove the market’s growth between 2020 and 2021.
It demonstrated both analytical accuracy and visualization design skills, and I received positive feedback from my professor for its clarity and insight.
